100 because i assume that would be enough to complete the 10 weeks and understand everyting, but can take longer (or less if my mentor helps me out / i bug him)

Day 1: lecture 0, Scratch assignment (easy)
Day 2: first quarter of lecture one, printed the notes, so far so good. Need to do this earlier though instead of late at night.
