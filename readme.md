CS50 course in 2025. First of a couple programming courses, which I will document and log here.

I guess a year later is better than never.

Goal: understand and finish CS50 by end of March. This means all psets, extra work, and the C handbook with its exercises.
Why? world is going AI, and understanding tech and engineering is important more than ever: for builders, indie hackers, content creators, a skill for a lifetime.
